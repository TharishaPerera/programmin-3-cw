# Programming 3: Data Structures and Design Patterns Course Project

This repository contains the coursework project for the "Programming 3: Data Structures and Design Patterns" module at Kingston University. The project is a web application that utilizes a queue data structure for managing and processing data. The front-end of the application is built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI for UI components, while the back-end is developed using Java and Spring Boot.

The core data structure utilized in this project is a **Queue**.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:**
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Shadcn UI (for UI components)

- **Back-End:**(API)
  - Java
  - Spring Boot
